My name is Chris, a BCS student at the University of British Columbia. My current interest lies in networks, backend and applied artificial intelligence, all which I get to explore as a current GenAI software engineering intern at Planview.

Last year, I contributed to and received an acknowledgement in the **[PLAICraft paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12707)**, a project collecting multimodal AI training data from Minecraft (see: [PLAICraft project site](https://plaicraft.ai/)). My current directed study is like a fork of it called **Project Elephant**; it's a PLAICraft for everything. If it's a desktop app that can be accessed via a cloud machine, it can be part of a framework for scalable AI training data capture. The current iteration of the project is focused on video conferencing and the online tutoring industry.

I'm currently looking for Summer 2026 internship opportunities in software engineering.
